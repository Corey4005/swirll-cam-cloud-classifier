# Task List
- [ ] Develop a set of rules for how contributing developers can engage with this repo. 
- [ ] Choose a cloud image dataset.
  - Possible find [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/cloud-type-classification2/data).
- [ ] Develop Convolutional Neural Network model and save it. 
  - What is that? [Here](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/cnn) is some documentation that may be helpful. 
- [ ] Test CNN model on images downloaded from [SWIRLL Roundshot](https://uah.roundshot.com/swirll/) and iterate. 
- [ ] Develop Github.io website wrapper that allows users to upload images of interest for the model to classify.

# Long Term EPIC idea
- [ ] Develop cloud detection bounding boxe when a specific cloud is identified in SWIRLL Roundshot
  - [What is a bounding box?](https://d2l.ai/chapter_computer-vision/bounding-box.html)
