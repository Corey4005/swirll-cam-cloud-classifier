# swirll-cam-cloud-classifier
The goal of this repository is to provide students at UAH with an opportunity to collaborate on a github project developing a cloud classifier for the SWIRLL roundshot camera.

# Task List
- [ ] Develop a set of rules for how contributing developers can engage with this repo. 
- [x] Choose a cloud image dataset.
- [ ] Develop Convolutional Neural Network model and save it. 
  - What is that? [Here](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/cnn) is some documentation that may be helpful. 
- [ ] Test CNN model on images downloaded from [SWIRLL Roundshot](https://uah.roundshot.com/swirll/) and iterate. 
- [ ] Develop Github.io website wrapper that allows users to upload images of interest for the model to classify.

# Updates
3/21/2022 
- Cloud data has been selected for labeling from the SWIRRL roundshot camera from the archive
[here](https://www.nsstc.uah.edu/swirll/cams/swirll/loopgen/). 
- Files were renamed from the download file tree to one directory location using [this](./data/sortfiles.py) script. 

# Long Term EPIC idea
- [ ] Develop cloud detection bounding box when a specific cloud is identified in SWIRLL Roundshot
  - [What is a bounding box?](https://d2l.ai/chapter_computer-vision/bounding-box.html)
