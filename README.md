# Welcome to swirll-cam-cloud-classifier repo!

The goal of this repository is to provide students at UAH with an opportunity to collaborate on a github project developing a cloud classifier for the SWIRLL roundshot camera. 

# Task List
- [x] Download raw cloud image dataset and share to this repo.
- [ ] Create labeled cloud database for other end-users in SWIRLL.
- [ ] Develop science questions for object detection of clouds.  
- [ ] Engineer some object detection models for cloud detection and provide documentation.
- [ ] Deploy models to application and demonstrate cloud detection use-cases using computer vision. 

# Image Labeler Used in This Project 
- Directions for download and documentation for the image labeler used in this project can be found in [this](https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg) repo.
